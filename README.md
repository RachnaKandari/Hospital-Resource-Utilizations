# Hospital-Resource-Utilizations
Analyzing hospital bed occupancy trends across Canadian provinces using Excel and Table

**Data Source**
This project uses publicly available data from the [Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI)](https://www.cihi.ca/en/hospital-beds-staffed-and-in-operation-2022-2023).


**Overview**
This project visualizes and analyzes hospital resource utilization across Canadian provinces using Excel and Tableau. The focus is on key metrics such as total number of beds available, average occupancy rates, and comparisons between teaching and non-teaching hospitals.


**Objective**

•	Understand healthcare capacity trends in Canada

•	Highlight underutilized and overburdened hospitals

•	Provide insights for public health policy decisions

•	Practice Excel pivot tables, conditional formatting and Tableau dashboards

**Tools and Technologies**

•	Excel: Data cleaning, pivot tables, slicers, charts
•	Tableau Public: Interactive Dashboard visualization 
•	GitHub: Version control and portfolio presentation

**Files Included**

•	Hospital Resource Utilization Dashboard – 2022-2023.xlsx
•	Tableau dashboard.twbx
•	Excel Dashboard Summary.pdf
•	Tableau dashboard.pdf
•	Tableau Dashboard Summary.pdf

**Key Features**

•	Pivot table analysis by hospital type and province
•	Conditional formatting to flag low occupancy
•	Slicers for interactive filtering (Teaching Status, Province)
•	Tableau dashboard comparing hospital-level vs province-level performance

**Key Insights**

•	Some provinces show consistently low occupancy, needing review
•	Teaching hospitals tend to have higher occupancy rates
•	Visualization helps pinpoint regional imbalances in healthcare resources

**Learnings**

•	Improved skills in Excel dashboard design and interactivity
•	Learned to connect calculated fields and filters in Tableau
•	Practiced storytelling using health data for real-world decisions

**How to View**

•	Excel dashboards: Open `.xlsx` and use slicers to filter by Province or Teaching Status
